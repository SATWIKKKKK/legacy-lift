// Backend stubs removed by user request.
// The backend folder has been intentionally diminished. Only model files (e.g. models/userModel.js)
// are retained. Implement the backend (routes, server, workers) from scratch as you prefer.

// If you need a sample server bootstrap later, I can provide a minimal Express server or Next.js
// API route examples — let me know which stack you prefer and I'll add that as a starting point.
